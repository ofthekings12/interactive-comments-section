### Built with

- React
- Javascript/HTML/CSS
- JSON Server


### What I learned

This was a difficult project. I was able to to complete all functions of the project and have it working on my local environment, but ran into issues when deploying it. Overall, some things I would do differenly would be to create a more robust backend and database, and build in smaller components.


### Continued development

I need to work on better practices when it comes to my code structure, and look into building a stronger backend.
